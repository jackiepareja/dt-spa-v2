They did their first walk with our bichon/poodle mix and very accommodating to her needs (older dog with a back that acts up sometimes). They're very friendly, punctual, and easy to communicate with. We have our next walk set up in a couple days and plan to use them 1-2 times a week. Would highly recommend!"/>

We are both working pup parents, so Romi walked Harper 2x a day and we always felt confident he was having a great time, getting plenty of play & exercise. Great for pup sitting during weekends away as well! And they send great pics :)"/>
